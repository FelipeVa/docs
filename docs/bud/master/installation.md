# Installation

Bud is best installed into a project using npx.

```sh
npx @roots/bud@1.0.0-rc.7 init .
```

Installing Bud globally is not recommended or supported.

::: tip Bud requires the use of yarn
While there are plans to support `npm` in the near future, Bud currently only officially supports `yarn`.
